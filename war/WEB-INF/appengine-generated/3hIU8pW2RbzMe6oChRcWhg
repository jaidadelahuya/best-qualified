give power to owner of acccount

warm colors, beautiful images, nice fonts etc are great but are variables dependent on individual preference which in turn is dependent on a host of other factors and conditions. meaning they may or may not add to our positive marginal utility.

when we look at websites,  what we see graphically is less than one-fourth of the work done in achieving a successful business model(that is if the business is successful in the first place), Our attention should be mainly tilted towards the flaws and winning edge concepts in the business model that we should or should not adopt to enable our business model break the law of diminishing marginal utility.

for example, hotnigerianjobs.com one of the scarpiest looking job sites is mostly found on top of job sites listings in nigeria because they adopted a business model with a very fast conversion rate. A friend sent me a link to a job on whatsapp, i viewed it on my phone, sent my application right there on the spot and in less than 3 days, I had a call from Chidinma to come for an interview, and is now part of my beauttiful story line. I was converted without even knowing the name of the website but after the interview, i found my way back, made several applications, sent links to some friends and not surprisingly, i got several calls to more interviews which i never attended because i was already taken...

The idea is, even facebook and linkedin if they remain as they are in ten years time will be a joke. so we practice what is called "idealization" or "back from the future thinking", we project ourselves several year forward with our minds high and imagine our business model is perfect in everyway. What does it look like? what have we done differently? what should we do differently? what haven't we done differently? what should our business model look like if we could wave a magic wand and make it perfect in every way?
